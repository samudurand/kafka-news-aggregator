Notes:
- need to decide which words need to be searched as:
    - full word
    - hashtag
    - part of words (ie. data)

Other sources than Twitter:
- Version updates:
    - Maven repo (assume we know which libs are interesting to follow):
        - already existing: https://www.artifact-listener.org/
        - my own implementation, maybe with a daily job to do it (play with airflow ?)

Advanced Features:
- detect when a Kafka event is happening (conference or other).
    For instance with a stream app that will analyse the tweets rates (this should not use the same rules as article based tweets, since we are looking for kafka mentions)
    Prob need a window concept, like tweets in an hour/day


- score tweet value:
    - twitter account popular ?
    - retweet count, likes count, maybe apply different scales depending on how long the tweet has been out
    - if video then video length > 10 min ? (youtube https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15596753/how-do-i-get-video-durations-with-youtube-api-version-3)
    - if article then
        - link domain ? (medium, ...)
        - text length ? (prob not a good meter)
